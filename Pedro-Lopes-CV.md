## PROFILE

Full‑stack engineer and software developer consultant with **4+ years** of experience, focused on **Angular** and **.NET**. I work end‑to‑end on web applications: frontend (Angular, PrimeNG, Bootstrap), backend (.NET Core/.NET 5–10, microservices), and infrastructure (Docker, NGINX, Azure).

I’ve been heavily involved in **modernizing legacy systems**, building **GDPR‑compliant platforms**, and designing internal CRMs and public‑facing portals. I also manage **CI/CD pipelines** (Azure DevOps, GitLab), set up infrastructure (Docker, NGINX, Azure), and participate in code reviews.

My main concerns are **clean architecture**, **strong typing**, **accessibility**, and **performance**.
